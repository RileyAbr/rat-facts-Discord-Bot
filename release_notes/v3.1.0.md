# 🐀 rat facts: the mini misc update

Hello rats! This patch introduces a new tier of "misc" commands. These are one-off commands that serve only a single (usually humourous) function. They are much more limited than the other fully-fleshed functions, but that doesn't make them any less fun!

## New Features

-   `!rat misc`
    -   Lists small, one-off commands
-   `!rat intimidate`
    -   Displays an intimidating rat
-   `!rat attattat`
    -   Displays a rat ready to roll out

## Fixes

-   Quite a few typos have been patches--especially in the lore story.
