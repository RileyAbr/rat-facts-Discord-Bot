# 🐀 rat facts: the final, final update

A few things were missing from the final update, so they have been added in here!

## Bug Fixes

-   Major project restructuring
    -   The entire project has been restructured to be more clear for future maintenance. The project now decouples the location of the commands and the data. Additionally, the commands are further divided by **main** and **misc.**
-   Fixed a few asset typos
