# üêÄ rat facts: the initiation update

Hello rats! With this update, users can now become one with the rats. This patch goes from simply serving up rat content for Discord users to allowing the Discord users to become content themselves. A new command is available, which will let people toggle their status as `@rats`.

## New Features

-   `!rat role`
    -   Become a rat. Use again to no longer be a rat
    -   _NOTE: Requires the server to have a `@rat` role created_

## Fixes

-   `.env` integration
    -   The bot no longer stores the Discord BOT_TOKEN within a config.json file! Instead, it is stored in a local .env file and loaded in with `npm dotenv`. This makes development much faster and streamlines the deploy process. On the user side nothing changes, but it is much cleaner under the hood!
    -   Updated the `.README` to match this new authentication
