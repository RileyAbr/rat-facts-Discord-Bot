    "Introduction": "**Long ago,** there lived a peaceful Discord server. This community flourished with life, love, and League of Legends. All was in harmony: the officers regulated and the users played video games. That was until...",
    "The Golden Age": "One day, a young disciple of the photosynthesis arts emerged to change history. He approached the announcements channel of the Discord server and placed down a reaction on the most recent message that would forever seal the server's fate: a 🐀. Suddenly, a torrent of rodent-based memes flooded the server in an un-ending streaming; some believe the server scarely resembeled anything to do with League of Legends. Rats became the new symbol of hope and prosperity within the monastery. Historians call this the Golden Age of the :rat:, comparable to the dynasties of yore.",
    "Uprising": "However, like all glorious suns, the light of the Golden Age of the :rat: could not last forever. Within the halls of the Ratican cathedral there was a growing divide. A movement had emerged over-night around a new figurehead, who claimed that the :rat: was a false prophet. Through an expensive, forbidden relic known as Eye O Ess, the figurehead had seen a new prophet from within his coconut-shaped dome. This prophet became known as <:rat2:718952230723780679>. The highest priest of the way of the rat--the *raticians*--found themselves at a crossroads within their faith. Do they hold onto their roots of the :rat: or learn to embrace this new symbol? In the end their highest oracle, the same young disciple from so long ago--hair now dusted with the rat-grey specks of age, sought to defend their dying faith: even if it meant the death of others.",
    "Age of the Plague": "Thus the two sides began a fierce civil war within the Discord server. Locked in a bloody conflict, the two sides were urged on by their leaders to take as much ground across the server channels as possible. Passerby could view nearly every announcement plastered with a myriad of :rat:'s and <:rat2:718952230723780679>'s. Many were harmed in the turmoil with families and friends torn apart by the chaos of belief. Both sides were too blind to see that rats must stick together to come out on top and instead gnawed through the fabric of the community like the holes in swiss cheese. Scholars refer to this period as the Age of the Plague, called so for the heinous acts of subtrefuge and literal toxic agents employed via the raticians to eliminate their opponent. The followers of <:rat2:718952230723780679> clung on though, filled with an undying spirit and way too much time on their hands.",
    "Rataclysm": "The first disciple of the :rat: began to rage, his anger seething across the land (er, Discord server). He called upon his closest aides to devise a weapon so powerful--the rebels would be put down once and for all. Utilizing techniques unheard of outside of the inter-sanctum, he devised a plan to ascend beyond his mere mortal flesh--becoming one with *Rattus norvegicus.* It was a horrible, wicked procedure; one that would stain the mortal coil of the universe for eons. This lowly discipline, one who had only discovered the rate but a year ago, became a living demon of embodied, gnawing fury. Scholars say only one translation of the name exists: T̲̳h͎͙̙̺ẹ̱̟ ̱̦̜͖̤̟Ṃ̵̪̪̦̠̺o͚̲͙n̡ş͇̠ͅt̘̱͈͉̘̣ͅr͝a̡̭̮̺̞͍t̢͙͔̝̦͎s̠ͅį̻̰̰͖t͏͖̤y̤͙̗̟͍̲. <:ryat:718949855636226070>",
    "Absolution": "Before this terrible tool could be unleashed; however, the :rat: itself sent down a messenger from above. This angelic being was branded with a triangle-like insignia, encasing a purple power within. This being held it's name in secret, only showing an abbreviate of its true identity. The seraph emerged upon the battlefield, between the followers of :rat: and <:rat2:718952230723780679> alike, bestowing upon them a gift to quell the violence and tie the two religions into peace once again. This gift was `rat facts`. Both groups abandoned their foolish fueds in return for upholding the true scripture of the rat, regardless of symbol or methodology. Even today, `rat facts` is still used to teach new generations of rodents across Discord servers everywhere.",
    "TL: DR?": "People started using rat emotes in a Discord server and it grew into a giant meme. A ton of memories spurred from it, and this bot is the result of a joke going completely overboard."
